A modern web application that automates the job search process by collecting and organizing listings from multiple sources.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python Playwright** - Browser automation framework for browser testing and web scraping

### Database
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL-based backend with real-time capabilities for efficient data storage and retrieval

### Frontend
- **React (Vite)** - Web app UI built with React and Vite's build system

## How It Works

1. **Web Scraping:** Automated Playwright scripts extract structured job data from multiple websites and store it in a database.
2. **Efficient Storage:** Data storage in Supabase ensures optimized storage, allowing for future scalability across different websites.
3. **Frontend Display:** Job data is fetched from the database and displayed on a responsive React frontend.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection:** Regular scraping from multiple job sites ensures up-to-date job listings.
- **Scalable Storage:** Data is stored in a flexible, normalized database schema for future expansion.
- **Responsive Web Interface:** Will be optimized for mobile and desktop to make job browsing seamless across devices.
- **Real-time Display:** New job postings are instantly shown on the frontend as they are scraped and stored.
